# ratelimiter-dotnetcore

Sample project for using dotnet core, docker and Testing Microservices.

Currently uses storyteller testing framework as I was interested playing with it.
Otherwise this is my recommended approach for setting up dotnet projects.

## Build Steps

1) ./run-docker-build.sh
2) ./run-functionaltests.sh

## Local Dev

1) ./run-dependencies-only.sh
dotnet run .....


test
